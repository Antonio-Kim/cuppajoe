        This website is a guide/blog about various aspect of Java that I have been learning. Personally, it's more of notetaking, 
        but I am hoping that this could be useful for others when learning about Java as well. 
        By no means these are correct, nor do I assume to be an expert, but as I go along the journey of mastering Java, 
        I hope to document and reflect back once in awhile, and I hope the readers find it useful at the same time.
