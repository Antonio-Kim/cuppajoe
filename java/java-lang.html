      <h2>Reactive Programming with Java Flow</h2>
      <p>
        Simply put, Reactive programming is an approach to program asynchronously between two or more entities using pub/sub model.

      <p>
        Reflection in Java is a technique to get information about specific Java class in runtime. Think of it this way: when you compile 
        a program, you have an input which instantiate a java class to an object, and then the object does some sort of work and makes
        output. Using reflection you can use that input(s), but also get information about the class, and using both of them to create 
        better output or even optimization. Things like configuration or sending data over network connection uses reflection. Examples 
        like Spring Boot or even JUnit uses reflection technique in their framework. Another example would be dependency injection.
